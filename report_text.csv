0,1996,AUG,MAURITANIA,"During the first decade of August, ()more() small swarms and groups appeared and laid in southern Mauritania where control operations commenced. Infestations were dispersed over a wide area. For example, there were four reports of small mature swarms north-west of Aioun El Atrouss (ca. 16431650N/0933-0949W) and three were treated. In eastern Trarza, a loose maturing swarm, covering an estimated area of 1230 ha, could not be treated east of Boutilimit at 1732N/1414W due to strong winds. Another one was treated after it was seen laying nearby at 1713N/1422W on the 8th. In southern Tagant, there were two reports of swarms near Moudjeria (1752N/1219W). A total of 585 ha were treated during the period. Some swarms my have already laid whereas others were drifting west through northern Brakna and reaching south-western Trarza. Consequently, bands of first to third instar hoppers began to be reported and treated near Aioun, hatching began east of Boutilimit in the same area and laying swarms and egg fields were found in the R’Kiz area (1654N/1518W) during the second decade. About 240 ha were treated during the period. During the third decade, mst infestations appeared to have shifted from south-eastern areas to the southwest. There was a total of six reports of small mature swarms, all in Trarza, but mst infestations consisted of small patches of young instar hoppers and hatchlings. Consecutive reports of swarms along the road south of Nouakchott throughout the decade suggested further mvement northwards. By the end of August, several swarms reached a few tens of kilometres south of Nouakchott, up to 1752N/1556W, and laid. Limited control operations continued against hoppers in eastern Trarza, whereas they were coming to an end near Aioun. A few isolated adults were seen at times during surveys undertaken between Aioun and the Tamchakett area (1715N/1040W), north of Timbedra (1615N/0810W) and in Hodh El Chargui up to Oualata (1718N/0702W). By the end of the  month, travellers reported hoppers north-west of Letvatar (1745N/1231W) in Tagant.","Breeding will continue during the forecast period in southern regions. In the south-east, any remaining hopper infestations are expected to fledge frommidSeptember onwards in the two Hodhs and my form small groups or swarmlets. These are likely to mve west towards Trarza. In the south-west, hatching will continue to occur from early September onwards in Trarza with fledging starting in early October. Numbers are likely to increase further in coastal and interior areas of Trarza and perhaps Inchiri due to further breeding and possible arrivals from the east. Elsewhere, small scale breeding my be in progress and continue in parts of Brakna and Tagant.",WEST AFRICA

2,1996,AUG,MALI,"On 26-28 July, two small mature swarms were treated near Gao covering 110 ha. Small patches and bands of first to second instars were reported in the same area on 18-22 August, indicating that undetected laying probably occurred in late July. A total area of about 12 ha was infested, at densities of 10-1,000 per sq mtre. Due to the presence of cattle, only 1 ha could be treated. Elsewhere during the first half of August, low numbers of mature transiens adults were reported along 60 km between Doro (1609N/ 0049W) and Gossi (1549N/0109W). Densities were up to 1,000 per ha; some adults were seen copulating. Scattered solitarious adults were also present at a few places between Gossi and Gourma Rharous (1652N/ 0156W).","Breeding will continue in the Gourma area between Gao and Tombouctou where current hopper infestations are expected to start fledging from late September onwards and my form groups and small swarms. Breeding is likely to be in progress in some parts of the Adrar des Iforas with hoppers appearing during September.

By the end of the  month, mst of the infestations consisted of late instar hopper bands and fledglings but only a few swarms suggesting that others my have mgrated north and eastwards. A total of 22,415 ha was treated by air and ground. During January, control operations continued against late instar hopper bands and fledglings in the above areas. There was also an increasing number of immature and mature swarms reported from the 3rd onwards. Some of these are thought to have mved north and eastwards as indicated by reports of a 24 sq. km dense maturing swarm on the northern coast at Marob (2151N/3648E) on the 16th and a few smaller swarms on the coast north of Port Sudan the following day. In Tokar Delta, mature swarms were seen laying from the 10th onwards and new hopper bands were reported from the 15th. This suggests that a second generation of breeding is underway. In the northern subcoastal areas, mature solitarious adults were present in Wadi Oko/Diib from Tomala (2002N/ 3552E) to Gabatit (2028N/3549E) on the 13-14th.

Consequently, second generation breeding is likely to extend into coastal areas north and south of Tokar Delta, producing an increasing number of hopper bands which are expected to form new swarms from early March onwards.

Other Locust species Afghanistan An outbreak of locusts, mst probably Moroccan Locust (Dociostaurus mroccanus), is in progress in the north where a recent Mission reported heavy infestations of third instar hoppers attacking wheat in Baghlan, Samangan and Kunduz provinces on 18-25 April. Local communities are trying to control these and other infestations. Earlier reports had suggested that about seven provinces in the north were affected by locusts. Control is often carried out mchanically in the country, by digging ditches and then directing hoppers into them. It appears that, under funding constraints, the system of mnitoring egg beds and carrying out early control has broken down. A FAO/UNDP project is in the process of assessing the situation with a view to proposing further action. Madagascar A survey carried out along the south-western coastal plains on 13-19 April confirmed that ()more() than 40,000 ha were still infested by transiens hopper and adult populations of the Malagasy Migratory Locust (Locusta mgratoria capito) and need to be urgently treated. Hopper densities varied from 10-100 hoppers per sq min the four heaviest infested locations, and adult densities were between 10,000-15,000 adults per ha. The phase structure of the population was characteristic of the end of a mjor plague but this does not exclude the possibility of a resurgence in locust activity especially given that, for this time of year, the ecological conditions are unusually suitable for hopper development and breeding.

2263,2001,JAN,MAURITANIA,"During January, there was a decline in the number of infested areas and in the locust densities in central and western Mauritania where locusts were present during December. In early January, another generation of breeding was in progress in the interdunal areas south of Atar (2032N/1308W) where solitarious and transiens adults, at densities up to 1,500 per ha, were seen copulating and first instar hoppers were reported until the 23rd. The first instar hopper densities were low except for one location where 7 hoppers per sq. m were seen on 40 ha on the 18th. By the end of the  month, adult densities had declined to 700 per ha. New reports from the north of scattered maturing solitarious adults at several places between Zouerate (2244N1221W) and Bir Moghrein (2510N/1135W) confirm that there was a small scale mvement northwards from the infested areas near Atar. This mvement almost certainly commenced in November and continued at times over the next few mnths during periods of warm southerly winds. Limited laying probably occurred in November with hatching in December as suggested by a single report of isolated fourth and fifth instar hoppers north-east of Zouerate on 30 January. No control operations were carried out during January.",Breeding is likely to continue on a limited basis in the north between Zouerate and Bir Moghrein and in southern Adrar near Atar. Hopper maturation is expected to be delayed by cool temperatures in these areas.

Bymid-month, mst of the hatching had ended, the mjority of hoppers had ﬂ edged and an increasing number of gregarious immature adults were forming groups and small swarms up to 5 km2 in size. As vegetation dried out on the Hadhramaut plateau between Al Abr (1608N/4714E) and Shhan (1746N/5229E), swarms moved during the second half of the  month west towards Shbwah, Abyan, Marib and Al-Jawf regions and reached the central highlands near Sana’a, Dhamar (1433N/4424E), Ibb (1358N/4411E), Ad Dali (1341N/4443E) and Al Baydha (1405N/4542E), and the Aden coast near Lahij (1303N/4453E). One swarm reportedly reached Al-Mahwait (1529N/4334E) in the mountains west of Sana’a. A few swarms also mved east into southern Oman. At the end of August, hopper groups and bands as well as small immature swarms continued to be reported in the Hadhramaut region, groups of late instar hoppers and scattered adults were present in Al-Mahara, immature and mature swarms were seen in Shbwah, and adults were present in Al-Jawf region. Some adults were reported to be copulating near Wadi Hadhramaut. Control teams treated 12,664 ha in August of which 3,080 ha were by air. Control operations were halted for a week due to insecurity and tensions with beekeepers in Hadhramaut.On the Red Sea coast, scattered immature and mature solitarious adults were present in the north near Midi (1619N/4248E) and on the central coast near Bajil (1458N/4314E). Adults were reported to be copulating near Bajil.","More swarms will form in Hadhramaut and Al-Mahara in September and movetowards Shbwah, Marib and Al-Jawf where they will mature and lay eggs. Hatching is expected to occur by the end of September and hoppers will form bands in October. Some swarms my continue to the central highlands and eventually reach the Red Sea coastal plains and the coast near Aden. If so, they will mature and lay eggs that should hatch and cause hoppers to form bands from October onwards. Consequently, locust numbers will increase on the Red Sea coast because of local breeding by current populations, supplemented by locusts that arrive from the interior and breed.",CENTRAL REGION

Scattered adults were also seen in the Asir Mountains suggesting that some locusts were starting to movetowards the spring breeding areas in the central interior. Both mvements probably occurred on winds associated with a storm over the central interior on the 26th. No locusts were reported elsewhere on the Red Sea coastal plains or in the interior.
